# FlaskBackupApp
Basic Flask Backup app
Overview
The Flask Backup Application is designed to manage and automate backup jobs. It features a simple web interface for creating and managing backup tasks, storing them in a database, and uploading files to Backblaze B2 cloud storage.

## Features
- Backup Management: Create, view, and delete backup jobs through a web interface.
- Cloud Integration: Upload files to a Backblaze B2 bucket using the Boto3 library.
- Database Support: Store backup job details in a SQLite database.
- Form Validation: Ensure required fields are filled using Flask-WTF.
- RESTful API Endpoints: Access and manage backup jobs programmatically.

### For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

## Install dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Set up your Backblaze B2 credentials in app/__init__.py:
python
app.config.from_mapping(
    B2_BUCKET_NAME='your-bucket-name',
    B2_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-access-key-id',
    B2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-secret-access-key',
    B2_ENDPOINT_URL='your-endpoint-url'
)
